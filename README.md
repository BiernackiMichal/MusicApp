Friendly Beat - Music App

My second project, which is a small music application written with howler.js library

In this project i've learned how to:

- validate user

- connect frontend written in Angular with backend written in C#

- create simple, SQLite database via Entity Framework

- validate login, register forms


Technologies used in this project:

- Angular2+
 
- TypeScript

- HTML

- CSS

- C#

- SQLite via Entity framework

- REST

- Node.js

example login if you don't want to register for some reason:

as moderator:
- username: newuser
- password: newuser

FIRST login might take few seconds.
